<h2><a name="disk_space">Storage on UEA HPC</h2>

<h3>Current information</h3>

<ul>

  <li>scratch. /gpfs/scratch/e058/

  <li>afm. /gpfs/afm/matthews/

  <li>If jobs are very high I/O, afm is not suitable so use
  scratch. Have set up mirror directory structures at
  /gpfs/scratch/e058/data/ and /gpfs/afm/matthews/data/

</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Each user is allocated disk space under their HPC home
  directory, plus on the scratch directories. Use <I>quotacheck</I> to
  see quota and usage for home and scratch spaces.

  <li>As of Jun 2015, there is a new research storage infrastructure
  being introduced (on /gpfs/afm/).  This has a blended cost (through
  tiered disk and tape based storage) of GBP100 per TB per year, so
  significantly cheaper than the old costs.  Research storage acts as
  an additional bulk data store for HPC, with a local cache of data
  on the dedicated HPC storage. The size of the HPC cache can be
  varied, with active data cached on the HPC storage and unactive data
  residing only on the research storage infrastructure.  There are a
  number of benefits to this,for example we can look at making the
  data accessible in multiple locations, for example in HPC, but also
  to Windows and Linux systems, also all storage is backed up.

  <li>Note that the afm storage is not suitable for high I/O, while
  the scratch and home spaces are. New approach after Jun 2020, after
  running into problems with this, is to have mirror directory
  structures on scratch and afm. At the beginning of a project, copy
  any input data from afm to the mirrored structure on scratch, do all
  the analysis using scratch, then copy output files from scratch onto
  afm. This is handled in the python scripts using the ARCHIVE Boolean
  flag.
    
  <li>20 Oct 2016.  /gpfs/afm/matthews/ Moved everything from old
  matthews and matthews-scratch disks to here, and deleted all old
  data.  Only 457 GB of data left.  Signed up for 2 TB of data (at <B>100
  GBP per year per TB</B>) for 5 years = 1000 GBP.  Filled out form and
  sent hard copy.

  <li>Can also access afm storage via uearclogin02.  For major data
  transfers from outside UEA, this is the preferred access method.
  Path is /data/matthews/.

  <li>Use '<B>du --block-size=1G -c --max-depth=1</B>' to see size of each
  subdirectory, and a total at the end (-c option).  Run from
  uearclogin02, as from hpc will only see the part of the fileset that
  is in the HPC cache.

  <li>14 Feb 2017.  Total use of afm/matthews/data/ is 1.2T, mainly from
  erainterim_plev_6h and trmm3b42v7_sfc_3h.

  <li>12 Oct 2018. Total use of afm/matthews/data/ is 1.4T.

  <li>18 Oct 2018. Total use of afm/matthews is 2.6T (1.4T from data
  and 1.3T from webber). Cleared out data directory, reduced from 1.4T
  to 0.3T. Total is now 1.6T.

  <li>8 Apr 2019. Total use of afm/matthews is 3.0T (0.8T from
  azaneu, 0.5T from data, 1.6T from webber.

  <li>17 Jul 2019. Total use of afm/matthews is 4.1T (0.9T from
  azaneu, 0.5T from data, 2.7T from webber. (Note that the .snapshots
  directory in afm/matthews does not count towards my quota. It is a
  backup process from ITCS.)

  <li>18 Jul 2019. Increased /gpfs/afm/matthews to 10 TB, paid until
  Jul 2025 (Contact is James Alborough in ITCS). Payment is: increase
  of 8TB (quota total now 10TB) now to Oct 2021 - £1,800, then 10TB
  Nov 2021 to July 2025 - £3,750. Total - £5,550.
    
  <li>1 Aug 2019. Total use of afm/matthews is 5.2T (1.2T from
  azaneu, 1.4T from data, 2.7T from webber. 

  <li>31 Mar 2020. Total use of afm/matthews is XXT (2.1T from
  azaneu, 1.4T from data, 1.9T from webber. 
    
  <li>7 May 2020. Total use of afm/matthews is 12T. 2.1T from azaneu,
  2.8T from webber, 6.4T from data (3.4 T imerg_sfc_30m, 1.1T
  erainterim_plev_d, 0.7T erainterim_plev_6h). Removed files in raw
  directories, to get data down to 2.3T (bringing total down to 8T).

  <li>Sep 2020. Had GBP1000 left on ELO. Used this to add another 2 TB
  for 5 years. James Alborough arranged this. Now have total of 12 TB
  that will expire on 31 Jul 2025.

  <li>18 Jan 2021. Total use of afm/matthews is 6T: 2.1T azaneu, 1.9T
  webber (which is all NEMO data that Marina is using), 2.0T data.

  <li>12 Oct 2021. Total use of afm/matthews is 11.1T: 1.9T webber, 0.8
  TB skinner, 2.0 TB karlowska, 2.4 TB azaneu, 3.9 TB data
    
  <li>15 Oct 2021. Total use of afm/matthews is 8.3T: 1.1T webber, 0.8
  TB skinner, 2.1 TB karlowska, 3.1 TB azaneu, 1.3 TB data

  <li><a href="http://www.jasmin.ac.uk">JASMIN</a> is the petabyte
  storage and cloud computing service run by NERC through
  CEDA. <a href="https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/account/login/">JASMIN
  account</a>. JASMIN helpdesk at support@jasmin.ac.uk.

  <li>BADC data can be processed and analysed on JASMIN.  

  <li>There are several JASMIN machines

  <ul>

    <li>login1.jasmin.ac.uk for logging into the system

    <li>xfer[1,2].jasmin.ac.uk for transferring data

    <li>sci[1-8].jasmin.ac.uk for <a href="
    https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/121-sci-servers"> general
    scientific processing</a>, including submission to the SLURM batch
    submission system.

  </ul>

  <li>To login to JASMIN, you should first ssh to
  login1.jasmin.ac.uk with agent forwarding enabled e.g. ssh -A
  matthews@login1.jasmin.ac.uk, and then ssh from there to
  sci[1-8].jasmin.ac.uk for access to BADC and NEODC archives (/badc
  and /neodc) and for any general processing.  To log onto
  login1.jasmin from ada, do
<PRE>
$ jexe # eval $(ssh-agent -s) # (used to be 'exec ssh-agent $SHELL')
$ jadd # ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jasmin
$ passphrase (extended waxwing)
$ jssh # ssh -A matthews@login1.jasmin.ac.uk
</PRE>

  <li>Running jobs.

    <ul>

      <li>py36 is alias to run my own python3.6 environment installed through anaconda.

  http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/cedaservices/wiki/JASMIN/Bbcp</a> 

  <li>My home space on jasmin was initially only 10 GB, but has now
  been increased to 1 TB.

  <li>24 Oct 2019. Installed conda environment with local python and
    iris installation on JASMIN.

    <ul>

      <li>On advice from Alan Iwi at CEDA support, downloaded
      miniconda (docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and scp'd to
	JASMIN and installed into /home/users/matthews/miniconda3/

      <li>Then created new py36 conda environment and installed iris
	etc. packages, using same commands as on hpc (notes from 24
	Apr 2018).

      <li>Initiate this using 'source activate py36' as on hpc.
      
    </ul>

  <li>Jul 2020. Major changes to JASMIN system.

    <ul>

      <li>The old LSF queuing system on lotus was switched off at the
      end of Jun 2020. Has moved to SLURM (same as ada). Do not appear
      to be able to submit SLURM job on lotus (sbatch is not in
      queue), but can submit on new machines (sci[1,2,3,4].jasmin)

      <li>python2.7 and the cdms python modules are not available on
      the new sci[1,2,3,4] machines (considered old code).
	
    </ul>

  <li>Several emails from JASMIN about new transfer machine
  hpxfer[1,2].jasmin.ac.uk, but could not connect to
  this. xfer1.jasmin.ac.uk still seems to work as usual.

  <li>JASMIN has a <a href=

<h2><a name="iris"> Iris, cartopy, matplotlib and other python
packages</h2>

<h3>Packages</h3>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/">Iris</a> is a
  python library for Meteorology and Climatology, written by the Met
  Office.

  <ul>

    <li>The Iris "cube" is the equivalent of a CDAT CDMS transient
    variable.

    <li>Use
    the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scitools-iris">
    scitools-iris Google group</a> for
    help. Also <a href="https://github.com/SciTools/iris/issues">iris
    issues</a> on github.

  </ul>

  <li><a href="http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/">Cartopy</a> is a
  Python package which allows the easy creation of maps, using
  matplotlib, for the analysis and visualisation of geospatial data.
  Cartopy comes with the Iris package.

  <li><a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> is the
  recommended visualisation package.  It is installed with the Iris
  package.

  <ul>

    <li>Use matplotlib.pyplot (convention: import as plt).  There are
    also matplotlib wrappers for the Iris cube within Iris called
    iris.plot (convention: import as iplt) and iris.quickplot
    (convention: import as qplt).

    <li><a href="http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/userguide/plotting_a_cube.html">iris
    matplotlib guide</a>

    <li>Color maps

    <ul>

      <li>Use <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org">Brewer color maps</a>
      (<a href="http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/userguide/plotting_a_cube.html#brewer-colour-palettes">implemented
      in iris</a>) where possible, e.g.: 'brewer_Purples_09',
      'brewer_RdBu_11'

      <li>Others: 'coolwarm', 'Purples'

    </ul>

    <li>When in interactive mode, plt.show() will plot the current
    figure to the monitor (using the backend).  If the monitor is
    smaller than the figure size (e.g., if using a laptop monitor),
    matplotlib rearranges (and ruins) the figure layout.  Use a
    non-interactive backend in this case, and just save the figure
    straight to file without first plotting on the monitor.  To do
    this, "mpl.use('Agg')" for PNG generation, before importing
    matplotlib.pyplot.

    <li>plot_iris.py.  Stand-alone advanced plotting script for a
    high-quality multi-panel figure.  Keep this up to date and use it
    as the canonical script for best practice technique for matplotlib
    plotting, and also to request help when errors occur.

  </ul>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/ajdawson/panel-plots/blob/master/README.rst">
  panel-plots</a> is a small package written by Andrew Dawson to allow
  complete control of overall figure size and panel position within
  matplotlib.

  <ul>

    <li>Create an instance of FigureSizeLocator following guidance
    below.

    <li>Font size is fixed so use figwidth to effectively set font
    size relative to panel sizes.  Iterate to a solution.  Larger
    figwidth means smaller relative font size.
 
    <li>Use figwidth and panelratio together to set both panel aspect
    ratio and, together with nrow and ncol, the height of the figure.
    Do not use figheight argument explicitly.

    <li>Use padbottom to leave space for legends and/or any further
    different panels to be created with another instance of
    FigureSizeLocator

<h3>Installation</h3>

<ul>

  <li>13 Nov 2015.  Installed iris on Asus Zenbook laptop running
  Windows 10.  First installed the Anaconda package manager (version 2
  as iris is still running under python2).  In an Anaconda Prompt
  window, typed 'conda install -c scitools iris' to install iris.

  <li>Installed jupyter notebook on Zenbook using 'conda install
  jupyter'.  NB 27 Jan 2016, after Windows 10 update, links from app
  menu to run jupyter disappeared.  Use Windows command prompt, and
  type 'jupyter notebook'.

  <li>Installed spyder (python2.7) on Zenbook.

  <li>(Note.  Also searched for uvcdat and cdat packages under
  Anaconda.  Only came up with cdat-lite but could not install.)

  <li><a href="http://ueapy.github.io/">ueapy web page</a> for all
  meeting summaries etc,
  and <a href="http://ueapy.github.io/pages/meeting-calendar.html">meeting
  calendar</a>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/ueapy/">ueapy github repository</a>

  <li>28 Sep 2016.  Running iris installation on grace.  The standard
  installation(s) set up by HPC do not work properly.  Run it using an
  anaconda environment.  In $HOME, one-off 'source
  setup_anaconda_on_grace.sh', which is Denis script downloaded from
  https://github.com/ueapy/grace-python/blob/master/setup_anaconda_on_grace.sh
  This creates an anaconda environment with python and iris module.
  Version 3.5.  Overwrites other python stuff on grace. 'python' then
  points to this installation.

  <li>2 Nov 2016.  Installing windspharm.  

  <ul>

    <li><a href="http://ajdawson.github.io/windspharm/api/windspharm.iris.html">Iris
    windspharm documentation</a>

    <li>Installed windspharm module by 'conda install -c ajdawson
    windspharm'.  However, get a GLIBC_2.14 library error when try to
    import windspharm.

    <li>Solution from Denis Sergeev.  On Andrew's channel, he has an
    old version of windspharm and its dependency - pyspharm, which is
    causing the error. So instead I installed windspharm 1.5.0 from
    conda-forge channel:  $ conda install -c conda-forge windspharm

    <li>However, that command updates the core python too, which has
    conflicts with glibc library too. So you need to downgrade python
    back to 3.5.2-0:  $ conda install python

    <li>Then you can check the installation simply by running $ python
    -c 'import windspharm'

  </ul>

  <li>8 Nov 2016.  Installing <a href="http://www.h5py.org">h5py</a>,
  to read HDF5 files (for TRMM data).  In python-iris directory, conda
  install -c scitools h5py.  This stopped iris.load and ncdump working
  so had to reinstall (ie update) iris (and hdf5) with 'conda install
  -c scitools iris'.

  <li>Running python on grace.  ipython.  run filename.py.  If changes
  made to the data_analysis module, import importlib;
  importlib.reload(da).  To clear memory do %reset.

  <li>16 Jan 2017.  Updating windspharm (on grace).

  <ul>

    <li>windspharm did not work with ERA-interim data (ValueError:
    latitudes are neither equally-spaced or Gaussian).  

    <li>Andrew Dawson - a tolerance parameter was set too small .
    Corrected now.  Update windspharm to v1.5.1 (from 1.5.0).  On
    grace: conda install -c conda-forge windspharm.

    <li>As before, the core python was updated too, leading to
    conflicts with glibc. conda install python (to downgrade python
    from 3.5.2.4 to 3.5.2.0)

  </ul>

  <li>16 Jan 2017.  Installing binstar (on grace)

  <ul>

    <li>conda install binstar

    <li>conda install anaconda-client

    <li>binstar allows you to search for packages, e.g., 'binstar
    search -t conda panel-plots' 
 
  </ul>

  Installing <a href="https://github.com/ajdawson/panel-plots/blob/master/README.rst">panel-plots</a>
  from Andrew Dawson.

  <ul>

    <li>Was not able to install as a package using 'conda install' as
    it does not exist as a package!

    <li>cd home/PythonScripts

    <li>git clone  https://github.com/ajdawson/panel-plots

    <li>cd panel-plots; python setup.py install

  </ul>

  <li>18 Jan 2017.  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gsw/">Gibbs
  SeaWater Oceanographic Package of TEOS-10</a>

  <ul>

    <li>Downloaded, gunzipped and untar'd package into
    ~/home/PythonScripts/gsw-3.0.3

    <li>python setup.py install

    <li>import gsw # to import package

  </ul>

  <li>19 Jan 2017.  Replacing python installation on Zenbook for
  Bangalore meeting.

  <ul>

    <li>Uninstalled anaconda3, anaconda2, and another ad hoc python
    installation as anaconda3 would not start (configuration clashes
    between v2 and v3?).

    <li>Installed Anaconda3, version 4.2.0, running
    python3.5.  <a href="https://www.continuum.io/">Download</a>.  Now
    only have one installation of python on Zenbook.  Keep it this
    way. 

    <li>Install iris under anaconda3.  Run an 'Anaconda Prompt'
    window.  'conda install -c scitools iris' fails because of an
    incompatibility between iris and the python3.5 that is already
    installed under Anaconda3.  Solution is to install iris from the
    conda-forge channel.  'conda install -c conda-forge iris'.

    <li>Use spyder to run python using ipython environment.

    <li>Installed panel-plots following same procedure as for grace
    (used git bash for unix shell).

    <li>Installed gsw Gibbs seawater package following same procedure
    as for grace.

  </ul>

  <li>19 May 2017.  Updated spyder on Asus zenbook.  Anaconda
  prompt. conda install spyder.

  <li>10 Jul 2017.  Trying to install gsw package on Chris's laptop.
  We found that gsw is actually available to install using conda.
  'conda install -c conda-forge gsw'.  (Found this through
  anaconda.org and then search packages).  However, Chris needs to
  possibly reinstall his conda environment!

  <li>11 Dec 2017.  Installed metpy package (including pint units
  package) on Asus zenbook.  conda install -c conda-forge metpy.

  <li>24 Apr 2018. Moving from grace to hpc, as grace will be turned
  off end May 2018. Also upgrade python to 3.6 and iris to v 2 etc.,
  at same time.

  <ul>

    <li>Preserve py35 conda environment that works perfectly on grace
    (it has issues with panel-plot module when run on hpc, at
    least). Scripts using iris 1 running on grace will remain in
    ~/home/PythonScripts/python-iris/, which is now defunct.

    <li>'module load python/anaconda/4.2/3.5' (the most recent
    version) to load conda.

    <li>'conda env list' lists your conda environments. Currently
    there are several, including: root (the default one) and py35 (the
    one I created). The * shows the currently active environment.

    <li>'source activate [env_name]' makes the env_name environment
    (e.g., py35) the active one.

    <li>Created a new conda environment py36 (from hpc) with 'conda
    create -n py36 python=3.6 -c conda-forge'.

    <li>'source activate py36' to make this environment the current
    one, and 'conda env list' to check.

    <li>Installed packages with 'conda install -c conda-forge iris
    cartopy'. Always use the conda-forge channel now. The scitools
    channel is redundant.

    <li>'pip install panel-plots'.

    <li>'conda install -c conda-forge windspharm'

    <li>'conda install -c conda-forge gsw'

    <li>'conda install -c conda-forge ipython' # as ipython was not in
    the python installation. This worked, but ipython cannot import iris.

  </ul>

  <li>To run python on hpc: <B>Xinteractive; py36 ( module load
  python/anaconda/4.2/3.5 ; source activate py36); ipython</B>
  . Scripts using iris 2 and running on hpc are in
  ~/home/PythonScripts/py36/

  <li><a href=
  "http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/whatsnew/2.0.html" >Changes
  to iris 2</a>. Main changes needed are:

  <ul>

    <li>remove all iris.future statements

    <li>Change all time constraints that use numerical time values to
    datetime objects.

  </ul>

  <li>6 Jul 2018. Updated windspharm with 'conda install -c conda-forge
  windspharm'. 

  <li>25 Oct 2018. On hpc, an error has developed with importing
  panel-plots. 'from panels import FigureSizeLocator' leads to an
  error. Tried 'pip install panel-plots' again under py36
  environment. Said it was already satisfied, but recommended 'pip
  install --upgrade pip' to upgrade from version 9.0.3 to latest 18.1
  version. Did this successfully. Tried 'pip install panel-plots'
  again, but still said it was already satisfied, so made no
  change. However, can now import FigureSizeLocator!

  <li>21 Feb 2019. Installed h5py under py36 with 'conda install -c
  conda-forge h5py'. This also updated several other packages,
  including numpy, python (3.6.5-1). However, now cannot import
  iris. Updated this with 'conda install -c conda-forge iris'. 

  <li>2 Aug 2019. Installed anaconda and python on new HP Elitebook.

  <ul>

    <li>Anaconda (Python 3.7 version) downloaded from www.anaconda.com.

    <li>Anaconda Prompt. conda install -c conda-forge iris
    cartopy. conda install spyder. conda install -c conda-forge gsw. 
    
  </ul>

  <li>Summary of updated installation notes (from Ben)

    <ul>

      <li>HPC:

	<ul>
      
	  <li>First, log onto an HPC interactive node, then run:

	    <ul>

	      <li>'module load python/anaconda/2019.10/3.7' (the most
	  recent version) to load conda.
	    
	      <li>Created a new conda environment py36 (from hpc) with
	  'conda create -n py36 python=3.6 -c conda-forge'.
	    
	      <li>'source activate py36' to make this environment the
	  current one, and 'conda env list' to check.
	    
	      <li>Installed packages with 'conda install -c conda-forge
	  iris cartopy'. Always use the conda-forge channel now. The
	  scitools channel is redundant.
	    
	      <li>'pip install panel-plots'.

	      <li>'conda install -c conda-forge windspharm'

	      <li>'conda install -c conda-forge gsw'

	      <li>'conda install -c conda-forge ipython' # as ipython was
	  not in the python installation. This worked, but ipython
	  cannot import iris.

	      <li>'conda install -c conda-forge cmocean' # cmocean colour maps
		
	      <li>'conda install -c conda-forge brewer2mpl' #
	      explicitly install Brewer colour maps, so can use with
	      general matplotlib contourf, not just iplt.contourf
		
	    </ul>
	
	  <li>To run python on ada: interactive;

	    <ul>

	      <li>module load python/anaconda/2019.10/3.7 ; source activate py36

	    </ul>

	</ul>

      <li>JASMIN: Log onto JASMIN

	<ul>
	
	  <li>To install:

	    <ul>
	    
	      <li>bash
	      /home/users/matthews/Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
		
	      <li>conda create -n py36 python=3.6 -c conda-forge

	      <li>source activate py36

	      <li>conda install -c conda-forge iris cartopy

	      <li>pip install panel-plots

	      <li>conda install -c conda-forge windspharm

	      <li>conda install -c conda-forge gsw

	      <li>conda install -c conda-forge ipython

	    </ul>

	  <li>To run:

	    <ul>

	      <li>source activate py36

	      <li>ipython

	    </ul>

	</ul>
		
    </ul>

  <li>12 Nov 2020. On ada in py36 environment, 'pip install cdsapi' to
  install API for downloading ERA-5 data from Copernicus Climate Data
  Store.

  <li>4 Jun 2021. On ada in py36 environment, 'conda install -c
  conda-forge motuclient' to install package for downloading OSTIA SST
  from Copernicus CEMS.

  <li>On grace (login node, git not installed on interactive nodes)

  <ul>

    <li>Initial set up

  <li>19 Jan 2016.  Gave up on multiple branches(?) with git.  Just
  update files on grace, then use git push to transfer to github.  For
  zenbook, just scp'd files over from grace.

  <li>Private github repository.  Default (and ethos) is that a github
  account is publically visible.  However, you can have a private
  github repository (useful for, e.g., confidential project
  documents), if you are a student, teacher or researcher.  Add your
  academic email address to your github account then fill in the form
  at
  <a href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new">
  https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new</a> 

  <li>16 Jun 2020. Started git and github again in training session,
  run by Jenny Graham and Tiago Silva.

    <ul>

      <li>On ada.

      <li>Initial set up.

	<ul>
	
	  <li>git config --global user.name adrianjmatthews # Use your
	  github account name.

	  <li>git config --global user.email
          adrian.j.matthews@gmail.com # Use the email your github
          account is registered with.

	  <li>git config --global color.ui auto

	  <li>git config --global core.editor 'emacs -nw'

	  <li>git config --global -l # lists all global settings

	  <li>git config --local -l # lists all local repository settings

	</ul>

      <li>Set up local repository on HPC.

	<ul>
	
	  <li>In home/PythonScripts/py36. git init.
	    
	  <li>git add data_analysis.py ; git commit (with message)
	    
	  <li>git remote add origin https://github.com/adrianjmatthews/py36.git

	  <li>Use .gitignore to tell git what to ignore. This is an
	  ASCII file that you just edit yourself.
	    
	</ul>

      <li>Github repository.

	<ul>
	
	  <li>Create empty repository on github website, with same
	  name (py36)
	    
	  <li>git push -u origin master

	  <li>For later pushes, once you have done 'git push -u origin
	  master' once, then you can just do 'git push' from them on
	    for later pushes.

	  <li>git pull # to pull latest version from github.

	  <li>Will be working with py36 repo on both UEA HPC and
	  JASMIN. Just work on one machine at a time. At beginning of
	  session, use 'git pull' to get latest version. Work on
	  code. At end of session, use git add and commit, and 'git
	  push' to push updated version to github.

	</ul>
	    
    </ul>

  <li>py36 is a private repository on github. To invite collaborators:

    <ul>

      <li>Ask for the github username of the person you are inviting
	as a collaborator.

      <li>On the github website, navigate to the main page of the
      repository, and click on Settings.

      <li>In the left sidebar, click Manage access, then "Invite a
      collaborator".

    </ul>

  <li>1 Dec 2020. Cloned py36 repo from github to JASMIN, with 'cd
  $HOME/PythonScripts; mkdir py36; git clone
  https://github.com/adrianjmatthews/py36'

  <li>17 Dec 2020. Cloned py36 repo from github to HP Elitebook, using
  git bash, with 'cd ... PythonScripts; mkdir py36; git clone
  https://github.com/adrianjmatthews/py36'. However, this created a
  new subdirectory py36 under py36 (i.e., repeated) so manually mv'd
  the new directory to PythonScripts/py36/ after. Have not yet tried
  pull or push from this so remember this step.

  <li>Jan 2021. Changing github access from username/password via an
  http URL to ssh keys using an ssh URL.

    <ul>
    
      <li>Username and password access to github will be discontinued
	in about 6 months.

      <li>Set up an ssh key pair with git, following
	<a href=
	"https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh"
	> info from github</a>. Created public/private keys id_ed25519
	and id_ed25519.pub in ~/.ssh on ada using ssh-keygen -t
	ed25519 -C 'UEA email address'. then started the ssh-agent in
	the background with "eval 'ssh-agent -s'". Then added my ssh
	private key to the ssh-agent with 'ssh-add
	~/.ssh/id_ed25519'. Then copied my public key id_ed25519.pub
	to my github account in a browser through the Settings tab
	(then SSH and GPG keys) on github.

      <li>To change from username/password access to using ssh key to
      access, need to change the github repo URL from an http: address
      (using username/password to access) to an ssh address (so can
      use ssh keys).  Use 'git remote show origin' to see what type of
      access you have set up (it shows
      https://github.com/adrianjmatthews/py36'. Then use one-off
      command 'git remote set-url origin
      git+ssh://git@github.com/adrianjmatthews/py36.git' to change
      this to the ssh URL to enable ssh access. Did this on ada.

      <li>Have done same process on JASMIN. Note I created a new,
      separate ssh key pair from the one used for UEA HPC. NB You can
      only access github on JASMIN from sci[1,2,4,5,7].jasmin.ac.uk,
      not sci[3,6,8], as the former are virtual machines and the
      latter are real, physical machines. Which is important,
      apparently.
	
      <li>Also done this on laptop.

    </ul>

  <li>When it goes wrong. Often due to making changes to a file on two
  machines without committing them in turn and pushing and
  pulling. Can use 'git reset HEAD' and 'git checkout filename' to try
  and get out of this. If you pull and get a merge error in a
  particular file, then open that file in an editor and search for the
  string 'HEAD' (emacs talks to git and actually takes you directly
  there). Can then hopefully see what the clash is. Edit the file
  accordingly, save it, commit it, then push it.
    
</ul>

<hr><!-------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2><a name="source">Data sources</h2>

<ul>

  <li>The "standard" data sets are
  multi-dimensional <a href="#gridded">gridded</a> fields with time
  dependence.  Most of the code in data_analysis.py is written to
  analyse these.  There are also
  one-dimensional <a href="#time_series">time series</a> and
  <a href="#time_invariant">time-invariant</a> data sets that are
  treated differently.

</ul>

<h3><a name="gridded">Gridded data sets</a></h3>

<ul>

  <li>Data directory on ada is one of two (mirrored) directories:

    <ul>

      <li>A directory in my scratch
      space <TT>/gpfs/scratch/e058/data/</TT>. This is where data
      should be initially downloaded to and processed. Once this has
      been done, it can be copied (archived) to ...
    
      <li>the mirror directory on the AFM storage
      facility <TT>/gpfs/afm/matthews/data/</TT>. This is used for
      long-term storage. If you need to reprocess data that is already
      stored in this AFM directory, then copy it back to scratch and
      do the processing there.

    </ul>

  <li>Directory structure: Data grouped by source.  A source
  (directory), e.g., <TT>ncepdoe_plev_d</TT> has three parts,
  separated by underscores:

  <ul>

    <li>data_source : e.g., <TT>ncepdoe</TT>. The horizontal grid is
    implicit in data_source, so related data on different horizontal
    grids need different data_source values.

    <li>level_type : e.g., <TT>plev</TT>

    <li>time resolution : e.g., <TT>w</TT> for
    weekly, <TT>d</TT> for daily, <TT>3h</TT> for 3-hourly, <TT>h</TT>
    for hourly, <TT>30m</TT> for 30 minute, etc.

  </ul>

  <li>In most of the source directories, there are 3 subdirectories:

  <ul>

    <li><TT>raw</TT> : contains the raw data as downloaded from
    external data repository

    <li><TT>std</TT> : contains the data from raw, reprocessed to
    standard configuration using preprocess.py, and filtered data,
    data with annual cycle subtracted.

    <li><TT>processed</TT> : contains time processed data such as time
    mean, lagged composites etc.

  </ul>

  <li>Note that <TT>raw</TT> and <TT>std</TT> directories both contain
  large files with e.g., daily data over many years.  Files in
  <TT>processed</TT> directory are generally much smaller (typically
  with no time dimension).

  <li>File structure and levels.  Usually, single-level data is stored
  in individual files, indicated by the LEVEL parameter in scripts,
  which is then included in file names, e.g., uwnd_850_2016.nc.
  However, for some smaller data sets (e.g., glider data), and for
  some more processed data (and therefore smaller data size), levels
  are combined into a single multi-level file.  The LEVEL parameter is
  then set to 'all'.

  <li>File structure and time blocks.

  <ul>

    <li>Depending on <TT>source</TT>, data is stored (by the time it has
    reached the <TT>std</TT> directory) in individual files with a
    standard size time block, determined by
    the <TT>outfile_frequency</TT> attribute for that source, which is
    currently either <TT>'year'</TT> or <TT>'month'</TT>.

    <li>This is to have a balance between individual files not being
    so large that data access takes too long, and not being so small
    that there are a very large number of files so again data access
    takes too long.

    <li>A practical compromise seems to be with individual files
    between 100 MB and 1 GB.

    <li>Hence, the data in the <TT>std</TT> directory is stored in files with
    the following name convention:

    <ul>

      <li><TT>outfile_frequency</TT> is <TT>'year'</TT>, file name
      is <TT>fileprefix_????.nc</TT> where <TT>????</TT>  is the year,
      e.g., <TT>olrinterp_toa_d/std/olr_0_2014.nc</TT>

      <li><TT>outfile_frequency</TT> is <TT>'month'</TT>, file name is
      <TT>fileprefix_??????.nc</TT> where <TT>??????</TT>  is the year
      and month, e.g., <TT>trmm3b42v7_sfc_3h/std/ppt_1_201404.nc</TT>

  <li><a href="http://www.incois.gov.in/tropflux/">www.incois.gov.in/tropflux/</a>

  <li>Updated to within 3-4 months of real time.

  <li>Longitudes (350) are every 1 degree, from 30.5 to 379.5 (19.5E),
  ie there is a 10 degree missing band (over Africa).  In
  preprocess.py add in the missing band (as missing data) and set to
  run from 0.5 to 359.9 (360 longitudes).

  <li>Latitudes (60) are every 1 degree from -29.5 to 29.5.

  <li>Time is every day, on the half day at 12 UTC, e.g., 24106.5.  In
  preprocess.py, convert to be at 00 UTC, ie subtract 0.5 day from
  time values.

  <li>Use tropflux_wget.py to retrieve data.

<h3><a name="time_series">Time series</a></h3>

<ul>

  <li>Time series are treated in a fairly ad hoc way, as their origins
  and raw formats are very diverse.

  <li>Typically have an individual bespoke preprocessing script (e.g.,
  preprocess_bsiso.py) to convert raw time series into a standardised
  form.

  <li>Directories:

  <ul>

    <li>On grace, base directory. <TT>/gpfs/home/e058/home/data</TT>
    for one-off time series.  Under the base directory is the data
    directory, e.g., <TT>bsiso_nl_d</TT> with its own <TT>raw</TT>
    and <TT>std</TT> subdirectories.

    <li>For one-dimensional time series created from a single grid
    point, or box area average, of a gridded data set, use the
    relevant <TT>std</TT> subdirectory of the gridded data set.

  </ul>

  <li>As with gridded data, just have one variable in one file.
  Format for processed file name
  is <TT>[var_name]_[level].nc</TT>, e.g., bsiso1-1_-999.nc.

  <li>Meteorological data from BoBBLE Jun-Jul 2016 cruise

  <li>Supplied by Vijaykumar, and then processed by Ben Webber.

  <li>Hourly time series

  <li>20170123_BoBBLE_IISc_Jan2017_4Andrian.pptx is powerpoint from
  Vijaykumar describing data.

  <li>BoBBLE_hourly_surfmet.txt # From Vijaykumar.  First line has
  time=180.0.  This corresponds to Julian day 180.0, which corresponds
  to 0000 (Indian Standard Time, IST) 28 Jun 2016, which is 1830 UTC
  on 27 Jun 2016.  "For U10, I followed a paper By Zeng et al., 1998,
  Journal of Climate Vol2. Basically takes into account the
  atmospheric stability functions and computed U10 from the measured
  value.  For specific humidity at the surface I used empirical
  formula 0.622e /( p 0.378e) where e is the saturation vapor pressure
  comes from Buck 1981. For air, basically is the same but accounts
  for relative humidity."

  <li>BoBBLE_hourly_radiation_component.txt # From Vijaykumar.  Date
  is a running number starting with 26 June and ending with 22 July.
  Some issues with net radiation not being the sum of the components
  all the time.  "Now the difference you noticed has come from the
  additional thing I did while processing. There was malfunctioning in
  radiation sensor, but I had another set of SW_in sensor fitted on
  the AWS. I plugged that data in the gap wherever missing data were
  noticed. So the net radiation what has been stored basically has a
  component of AWS SW_in also.  Therefore net will not match if
  computed from radiation sensor alone and that is why you are seeing
  the difference.  Additionally, net can be computed from the
  radiation data itself . That is absolutely fine.  Few data points at
  the start may not be reliable therefore can be discorded, similarly
  when sensor recovered after failure few data points may not be
  reliable because that is warming period and senor needs to get
  stabilized.  "

  <li>bobble_hourly_met_20170125.nc # Processed by Ben.  Uses the
  estimate from Payne (1972) to fill in the gap where I have judged
  the upwelling SW measurements to be bad. These data points are
  recorded in the variable QSW_flag, and both SW_up (measured) and
  SW_up_est (estimated) are included along with SW_dn, and QSW (net
  shortwave).

  <li>Time invariant data sets are also treated in an ad hoc way. 

  <li>On grace, base directory is <TT>/gpfs/home/e058/home/data</TT>
  Under the base directory is the data directory,
  e.g., <TT>gebco_sfc_ti</TT> (note that <TT>ti</TT> stands for 'time
  invariant') with its own <TT>raw</TT> and <TT>std</TT>
  subdirectories.

  <li>As with gridded data, just have one variable in one file.

  <li>Data is stored in elevation_1.nc as a 2D array of 2-byte signed
  integer values, saving considerably in storage.  NB This is the raw
  data, unchanged from the download from BODC, but stored in
  the <TT>std</TT> directory, i.e., no preprocessing was done, or was
  necessary.

<h2><a name="data">(netcdf) data conventions</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Netcdf data should be written according to these <a
  href="http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/netcdf/BestPractices.html">
  Best Practices</a>

  <li>Also, there is an accepted list (CF-compliant) of
  "standard_name" and "units" attributes: <a href=
  "http://cfconventions.org/documents.html"> List of standard names
  with detailed descriptions of variables</a>

  <li>There doesn't seem to be a convention on the id/name attributes
  though. 

  <li>See var_name2standard_name in data_analysis.py for dictionary of
  my netcdf id/name attributes, and their CF-compliant standard_name

  <li>Use 'ncdump -c filename.nc' to get information on headers and
  coordinates of netcdf file.

<h2><a name="scripts">Python scripts</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Most scripts use
  the <A HREF="../PythonScripts/py36/data_analysis.html">data_analysis</A>
  module ('pydoc -w data_analysis' on UEA HPC to update. NB it must be
  pydoc -w data_analysis, not data_analysis.py).

  <li>info.py.  Information on locations, sections, etc.

  <li>Running multiple scripts

  <ul>

    <li>To submit a single script to a batch job, <TT>sbatch

    job via the unix command line from an interactive node on ada.

    <li>To loop over years, months, levels etc, and submit multiple
    jobs to the batch system, <TT>run_scripts_sub.py</TT>, from
    an <I>interactive</I> node, as interactive node needed to run
    py36, and bizarrely you can submit a batch job from within a
    python script on an interactive
    node.
